# Module: Computer Architecture
> Intrinsics of the CPU

## Prelude
This module at our university thought us about the inner workings of a computer:
- numeric systems (base 2, 8, 10, 16)
- assembly basics (Linux, NASM, x86 or x86-64)
- architecture history (mostly just intel history)


This repo basically holds the solutions to the exercises given.

## Exercises
**DISCLAIMER: ONLY SOLUTIONS ARE PRESENT HERE. THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL WAS NEVER PUBLISHED.**
- _a2r:_ Convert decimal number to roman numerals
- _bubblesort:_ bubblesort!
- _conv16to10:_ Convert a decimal to hexadecimal
- _conv10to16:_ Convert a hexadecimal to decimal
- _fixedpoint:_ Calculate the full 32-bit float of a division (IEE754 Single Precision)
- _schraeg:_ Print the given argument diagonally
- _QMC:_ This is a simplified (recursive) implementation of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. (Infos [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quineâ€“McCluskey_algorithm))

Each of these exercises were done with ubuntu on WSL 2.0 using NASM and as 64bit.


Happy browsing! Hope this helps you!

## Extras
`asm64` is basically a fancy assembler script, you can use it to compile your stuff if you're lazy to type out the commands lmao
